If you have trouble with any of the packages, join us in the [chatroom](https://gitter.im/thunder-project/thunder), or open an issue on the GitHub repository for the package that you are using. If in doubt, open an issue [here](https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder/issues).

If you have an idea for a new feature, you can either open an issue, or try to implement it yourself and submit a pull request to one of the packages! You can also write your own separate package that works well with the others. If you do, open an issue on the [repository for this documentation page](https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder-docs) and we'll add it to the list!

Thunder is organized into several different packages, so that each one can solve one problem well, and some can be very general, whereas others can be very specific. If you write a package to solve a domain-specific problem, it might make a great standalone packages! Reach out in the chatroom to discuss ideas.
