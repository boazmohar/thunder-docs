# data types

Thunder and its associated packages define and make use of two primary types of data: `images` and `series`. Each one is a high-level wrapper for an ndarray, and can be used in either a local setting (via [`numpy`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)) or a distributed setting (via [`spark`](https://github.com/apache/spark) and [`bolt`](https://github.com/bolt-project/bolt)). These data types can be loaded from a wide variety of local or remote data (see data loading), can be manipulated through statistical operators, and can be written to disk in several different formats. These data types are defined as classes in the core [`thunder`](https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder) package. See the documentation sections on "image data" and "series data" for a list of methods for loading and manipulating these data types.
