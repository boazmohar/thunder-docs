# thunder-docs

> documentation for thunder and related modules

This repository contains two things:

- example tutorial notebooks for [`thunder`](http://thunder-project.org)
- a static documentation site made with [`minidocs`](https://github.com/freeman-lab/minidocs).

You can run the notebooks interactively by clicking the Binder badge.

To build the site, clone this repo then call

```
npm install
npm run build
```

And serve with

```
http-server site
```

Or similar.
